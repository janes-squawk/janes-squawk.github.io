So glad you\'re joining us!</h3><br><p>We\'re two Queens residents who were inspired to learn more about the hundreds of birds that visit our borough every year, and which ones New Yorkers can expect to see this spring.</p><p>As you might have guessed, we\'re not professional birders! Rather, we\'re researchers, mapmakers, and data analysts who wanted to use these skills to tell a story about the incredible birds in our borough. In addition to understanding the geography, science, and numbers behind birds in Queens, we\'ll lead you on a virtual walk of the West Pond Trail of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, one of the best places to spot birds in New York City.</p><p>Ready? Let\'s get started!</p><img src="images/Bird-Eggs.jpg" alt="Bird Eggs">';

let divChapter2 = '<h3>First, a little context.</h3><br><p>Over 400 bird species have been documented in New York City, more than half the species regularly found in North America. Of these, over 370 species have been documented in Queens, more than any other borough according to <a href="https://ebird.org/about" target="_blank">eBird</a>, an open-source database managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</p><p>Jane\'s Walk is one of the best weekends of the year to spot many of these birds. That\'s because the festival happens in the middle of the spring bird migration, which occurs from about March to June in New York City for most birds, with a peak in May for shorebirds and most songbirds.';

The 3,000-mile route generally starts in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic, then follows the Atlantic coast through Canada and the United States to the tropical areas of the Caribbean and South America.</div>';

Although they are among the most endangered of habitats because of competition from development and remain rare even in New York City, infill sites that were underutilized have restored fields to the great benefit of nesting and migrating birds. Fields require maintenance for the managed growth and cultivation of native species as well as limited pesticide use. Where fields might meet another habitat, like a forest, the variety of plant species can attract more animals, including birds.</p>`;

Located in a low-middle-income area of the city, with a median household income of around \$50,000, the hospital serves one of the most diverse and immigrant dense areas of the city. The three subway stations around the hospital have all seen relatively small change in their usage compare to the rest of the city.</p>`;

It was in fact the declaration of a state of emergency, on March 7, 2020, that precipitated this near total drop in subway ridership.</p><p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>After a few weeks of the declaration of state of emergency, subway usage in the city reached its lowest point, almost 90% less than the same time period the year before. Since then, the number of people that use the subway has remained drastically low. Even after the city began its re-opening scheme on June 8, 2020, subway usage was still more than 70% below 2019 levels.</p><div style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"><iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/529512696" width="600" height="277.5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>This difference, however, varies across the city, with some parts of it seeing a much steeper decline and others witnessing a stronger recovery. Nevertheless, even a year after the pandemic first hit New York City, the number of daily subway commuters remains below 2019 levels.</p><p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>That being said, other transportation networks have fared differently. For example, after a similar decline right after the state of emergency was declared, Citibike has seen its number of users reach and even surpass 2019 levels. City buses, on the other hand, also remain underutilized compared to their usage pre-pandemic.</p>`;

The area's three main neighborhoods, Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris are mostly home to low-income families that have been forced to continue going to work, risking their health and that of their loved ones. Similarly to Jackson Heights in Queens, the areas subway stations have seen a smaller decrease in use than the rest of the city. Median household income in this area oscillates between \$15,000 and \$30,000.</p>`;
