<h1>Jane's Squawk/h1>
<p>Have you ever wondered who’s chirping in the trees in the morning? Who’s perched on that telephone wire? Who’s fluttering across the sunlit sky? This virtual walk will dive into the avian world of Queens through the lens of two Queensites who were fascinated to learn more about the birds in our midst. Using crowdsourced historical data, we look at the hundreds of birds that New Yorkers are seeing in places like the Rockaways, Forest Park, and your neighborhood street, from long-legged shorebirds to colorful warblers to elegant swallows. We then put our novice birding skills to the test and see what we can find when we venture out ourselves. Join us as we embark on a multimedia, on-demand tour of the birds you can spot this spring across Queens. All you need is an internet connection and a sense of curiosity! </p>
