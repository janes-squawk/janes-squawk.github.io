      <p>Welcome! So glad you’re joining us on this virtual walk!</p>
      <p>We’re two Queens residents who were inspired to learn more about the hundreds of birds that visit our borough every spring.</p>
      <p>As you might have guessed, we are not professional birders! Rather, we are mapmakers and data junkies with a desire to understand and share what you can expect to see and hear this Jane’s Walk weekend in the avian world of Queens. In addition to understanding the geography, science, and numbers behind birding in Queens, we’ll lead you on a virtual walk of the West Pond Trail of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, one of the best places to spot birds in New York City.</p>
      <p>Let’s get started!</p>
      <p>[Transition element]</p>
      <p>First, a little context. Over 400 bird species have been documented in New York City, more than half the species regularly found in North America. Of these, over 370 species have been documented in Queens, more than any other borough according to eBird, an open-source database managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. </p>
      <p>Jane’s Walk is one of the best weekends of the year to spot many of these birds. That’s because the festival happens in the middle of the spring bird migration, which occurs from about March to June in New York City for most birds, with a peak in May for shorebirds and most songbirds.</p>
      <p>[Migration graphic]</p>
      <p>The sheer number of birds in Queens is due in part to the borough’s location along the Atlantic Flyway, one of four major north-south routes that birds travel in North America during the spring and fall migrations. The 3,000-mile route generally starts in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic, then follows the Atlantic coast through Canada and the United States to the tropical areas of the Caribbean and Central and South America. </p>

      <p>The proliferation of birds in Queens is also due to the borough’s abundance of open space—more than any other borough—which provides five primary bird habitats: forests, fields, freshwater, salt marsh, and seashore. </p>
      <p>[Description and visuals of different habitats and types of birds found in each]</p>
      <p>Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is comprised of 9,000 acres (20 square miles) of open bay, saltmarsh, mudflats, upland fields and woodland, small freshwater ponds, and two brackish man-made impoundments – the 117-acre East Pond and the 45-acre West Pond. Part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is the U.S. Department of the Interior’s only wildlife refuge administered by the National Park Service. </p>

      <p>Over 332 bird species have been sighted at the refuge over the last 25 years, in addition to other native wildlife like horseshoe crabs, diamondback terrapin, and muskrats. According to NYC Audubon, approximately 70 bird species nest regularly at the refuge. </p>
      <p>The organization notes that in spring, Jamaica Bay is visited by numerous shorebirds, waterfowl, wading birds, terns, flycatchers, cuckoos, warblers, and tanagers, as well as the American Woodcock, which performs courtship displays by the Visitors Center at dusk. The West Pond as well as surrounding marshes are known to be especially good for viewing migratory shorebirds in breeding plumage, including the black bellied and semipalmated plovers, red knot, and short-billed dowitcher.</p>
