      <h4>Welcome to our virtual Jane's Walk! So glad you’re joining us!</h4>
      <p>We’re two Queens residents who were inspired to learn more about the hundreds of birds that visit our borough every year, and which ones New Yorkers can expect to see this spring.</p>
      <p>As you might have guessed, we're not professional birders! Rather, we're researchers, mapmakers, and data analysts who wanted to use these skills to tell a story about the incredible birds in our borough. In addition to understanding the geography, science, and numbers behind birds in Queens, we’ll lead you on a virtual walk of the West Pond Trail of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, one of the best places to spot birds in New York City.</p>
      <p>Ready? Let’s get started!</p>
      <br>
      <p>[Transition element]</p>
      <br>
      <p>First, a little context. Over 400 bird species have been documented in New York City, more than half the species regularly found in North America. Of these, over 370 species have been documented in Queens, more than any other borough according to <a href="https://ebird.org/about" target="_blank">eBird</a>, an open-source database managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</p>
      <p>Jane’s Walk is one of the best weekends of the year to spot many of these birds. That’s because the festival happens in the middle of the spring bird migration, which occurs from about March to June in New York City for most birds, with a peak in May for shorebirds and most songbirds.</p>
      <br>
      <p>[Migration graphic]</p>
      <br>
      <p>The sheer number of birds in Queens is due in part to the borough’s location along the Atlantic Flyway, one of four major north-south routes that birds travel in North America during the spring and fall migrations. The 3,000-mile route generally starts in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic, then follows the Atlantic coast through Canada and the United States to the tropical areas of the Caribbean and South America.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Broadly, Queens boasts <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/nrg/documents/NRG_Publication_A_Guide_to_the_Birds_of_Queens.pdf" target="_blank">five distinct habitats</a>: field, forest, freshwater, salt marsh, and seashore&mdash;all with tremendous biodiversity, not the least in avian species (the “birdiest borough,” so says <a href="https://www.nycaudubon.org/events-birding/birding-resources/birding-in-nyc/birding-in-queens" target="_blank">NYC Audubon</a>!). From the eager chirping that signals morning (and for many of us, serves as a natural alarm clock!) to the flocks that fly in neat formation over buildings and bodies of water alike, birds are an ever-present neighbor.</p>
      
      <p>Not surprisingly, many birds can be spotted in some of Queens’ largest parks and protected nature areas, including Alley Pond, Forest, and Flushing Meadows-Corona Parks as well as the Jamaica Wildlife Refuge. Even as we appreciate them from afar (and occasionally share a bench with a pigeon), we have to consider how to mitigate the effects of human activity on nature.</p>

      <h4>A Virtual Jane's Walk of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge</h4>
      <p>On April XX, we ventured out to the West Pond Trail of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge to see whether the birds we researched were in fact observable, and where. The approximately two-mile trail is situated in Broad Channel, an inhabited island in the middle of Jamaica Bay that's reachable by car and the Q52 and Q53 Select Buses.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is a spectacular oasis, comprised of 9,000 acres (20 square miles) of open bay, saltmarsh, mudflats, upland fields and woodland, small freshwater ponds, and two brackish man-made impoundments – the 117-acre East Pond and the 45-acre West Pond. Part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, the Refuge is the U.S. Department of the Interior’s only wildlife refuge administered by the National Park Service.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nycaudubon.org/events-birding/birding-resources/birding-in-nyc/birding-in-queens/jamaica-bay-wildlife-refuge">NYC Audubon</a>, over 332 bird species have been sighted at the refuge over the last 25 years, in addition to other native wildlife like horseshoe crabs, diamondback terrapin, and muskrats.  Of these, approximately 70 bird species nest regularly at the refuge. </p>
      <p>NYC Audubon notes that in spring, Jamaica Bay is visited by numerous shorebirds, waterfowl, wading birds, terns, flycatchers, cuckoos, warblers, and tanagers, as well as the American Woodcock, which performs courtship displays by the Visitors Center at dusk. The West Pond and surrounding marshes are known to be especially good for viewing migratory shorebirds in breeding plumage, including the black bellied and semipalmated plovers, red knot, and short-billed dowitcher.</p>
